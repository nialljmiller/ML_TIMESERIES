Welcome to the Synthetic Light Curve Generator! 🌟 This repository provides a toy model light curve simulator that aims to create VVV-style periodic variable light curves. It includes examples of regression with standard fitting and Gaussian processes using the `linear_reg` and `linear_reg_gp` modules, respectively.

### Features

🔬 **Regression Examples**: This repository offers two regression examples for fitting light curves: `linear_reg` and `linear_reg_gp`. You can explore these modules to gain insights into different regression techniques.

🎢 **Light Curve Simulation**: The core component of this repository is the `synthetic_lc_generator.py` module. It provides a light curve simulator that allows you to generate synthetic light curves resembling VVV-style periodic variable light curves.

⚙️ **Usage**:
To use the synthetic light curve generator, simply import the `synthetic_lc_generator` package in your project. Here's an example of how to import it:

```python
import synthetic_lc_generator as lc_gen
```

Once imported, you can generate synthetic light curves using the `simulate_light_curve` function. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
mag, magerr, time, class, period = lc_gen.simulate_light_curve(seed_t, period, amplitude, cat_type, seed_m, other_pert=1, err_rescale=1, scatter_flag=1, contamination_flag=1)
```

🔎 **Testing Period Detection**:
The synthetic light curve generator is particularly useful for testing the accuracy of your period detection algorithms. You can experiment by adding or removing noise and external effects to observe how your fitting code performs under various conditions. This flexibility allows you to evaluate the robustness and limitations of your algorithms.
